<h1>iPhone Location Data</h1>

<p>As <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/20/iphone-tracking-prompts-privacy-fears" title="Guardian article">reported by the Guardian</a>, the iPhone keeps unencrypted location data in a file on the phone, which is also backed up to your computer via iTunes. Some security researchers found the data and have put together a tool for you to extract that data easily.
I followed <a href="http://dropstones.blogspot.com/2011/04/extracting-iphone-ios4-location-data-in.html" title="Dropstones">this post</a> to recover the raw location data from my phone, over 11000 records. Here is that data, on a map.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27location_qa.html">Apple released a Q+A on this data</a>, concluding it is not all your location data but a subset of the location database they keep, cached on the device to help the location services work faster when required.</p>
